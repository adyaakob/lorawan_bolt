        <div class="prose max-w-full">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Project Background</h3>
          <p>This project aims to enhance worker safety and optimize operational efficiency in Sabah Softwoods Berhad's oil palm plantations. Traditional tracking methods are inadequate due to the vast, densely vegetated areas and limitations of GPS and cellular signals under the palm canopy. This LoRaWAN-based system seeks to overcome these challenges by providing real-time worker location data and reliable communication, even in areas with limited cellular coverage.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Key Requirements</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>Real-time tracking:</strong> Continuous monitoring of 4,500 workers across nine estates (Mawang, Sg Tiagau, Bukit Tuok, Kumani, Kapilit, Sg Indit, Banita, Cenderamata, and Dumpas).</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Utilize LoRaWAN technology for its long-range coverage (up to 10km in rural areas) 1, low power consumption, and ability to penetrate dense foliage.</li>
